# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description

This is a simple application that allows users to view, write, and delete notes. The application uses a server to serve resources, webpages, and information.

The assignment's front end was already complete, with only the back end server functionality needing to be developed.

## Process

I largely copied the complete code from the Star Wars and Hot Restaurant activities, with some modifications for the way the Note Taker was structured.

## Challenges

Naturally, the greatest challenge came from syntax issues where I misplaced a bracket or comma. 

Besides that, understanding how the assignment was meant to be completed took the majority of my time

## Overall

Fun assignment, not especially challenging, and required students to fully understand Express servers and requests.
